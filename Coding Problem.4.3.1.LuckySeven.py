#Write a function, called lucky_sevens, that takes in one
#parameter, a list of integers, and returns True if the list
#has three '7's  in a row and False if the list doesn't.
#
#For example:
#
#  lucky_sevens([4, 7, 8, 2, 7, 7, 7, 3, 4]) -> True
#  lucky_sevens([4, 7, 7, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4, 3]) -> False
#
#Hint: As soon as you find one instance of three sevens, you
#could go ahead and return True -- you only have to find it
#once for it to be True! Then, if you get to the end of the
#function and haven't returned True yet, then you might
#want to return False.


#Write your function here!
def lucky_sevens(mylist):
      if mylist.count(7) > 3:
            return True
      else:
            return False


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: True, then False
print(lucky_sevens([4, 7, 8, 2, 7, 7, 7, 3, 4]))
print(lucky_sevens([4, 7, 7, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4, 3]))
