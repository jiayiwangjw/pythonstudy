#We've given you a class called "Song" that represents
#some basic information about a song. We also wrote a 
#class called "Artist" which contains some basic 
#information about an artist.
#
#Your job is to create three instances of the song class,
#called song_1, song_2, and song_3.
#
#song_1 should have the following attributes:
#   name = "You Belong With Me"
#   album = "Fearless"
#   year = 2008
#   artist.name = "Taylor Swift"
#   artist.label = "Big Machine Records, LLC"
#
#song_2 should have the following attributes:
#   name = "All Too Well"
#   album = "Red"
#   year = 2012
#   artist.name = "Taylor Swift"
#   artist.label = "Big Machine Records, LLC"
#
#song_3 should have the following attributes:
#   name = "Up We Go"
#   album = "Midnight Machines"
#   year = 2016
#   artist.name = "LiGHTS"
#   artist.label = "Warner Bros. Records Inc."
#
#Notice, though, that song_1 and song_2 have the same
#artist and label. That means they should each have the
#SAME instance of artist: do not create separate instances
#of artist for each song.
#
#When your code is done running, there should exist three
#variables: song_1, song_2, and song_3, according to the
#requirements above.

class Artist:
    def __init__(self, name, label):
        self.name = name
        self.label = label

class Song:
    def __init__(self, name, album, year, artist):
        self.name = name
        self.album = album
        self.year = year
        self.artist = artist
        

#Write your code here!
my_artist_1 = Artist("Taylor Swift", "Big Machine Records, LLC")
my_artist_2 = Artist("LIGHTS", "Warner Bros. Records Inc.")

song_1 = Song("You Belong With Me", "Fearless", 2008, my_artist_1)
song_2 = Song("All Too Well", "Red", 2012, my_artist_1)
song_3 = Song("Up We Go", "Midnight Machines", 2016, my_artist_2)
