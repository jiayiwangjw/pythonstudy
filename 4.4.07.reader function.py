#Write a function called "reader" that reads in a ".cs1301" 
#file described in the previous problem. The function should 
#return a list of tuples representing the lines in the file like so:
#
#[(line_1_number, line_1_assignment_name, line_1_grade, line_1_total, line_1_weight), 
#(line_2_number, line_2_assignment_name, line_2_grade, line_2_total, line_2_weight)]
#
#All items should be of type int except for the name (string) 
#and the weight (float). You can assume the file will be in the 
#proper format -- in a real program, you would use your code
#from the previous problem to check for formatting before
#trying to call the function below.
#
#Hint: Although you could use readlines() to read in all
#the lines at once, they would all be strings, not a list.
#You still need to go line-by-line and convert each string
#to a list.


#Write your function here!
def reader(filename):
    file_reader = open(filename)
    results = []
    
    for line in file_reader:
        parts = line.split(" ")
        line_tuple = (int(parts[0]), parts[1], int(parts[2]), int(parts[3]), float(parts[4]))
        results.append(line_tuple)
    
    file_reader.close()
    return results


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print:
